ðŸ’° Problem: Non-Constructible Change
You're given an array of positive integers coins. Each integer represents a coin of that value.
Write a function that returns the minimum amount of change that cannot be created using any combination of the coins.

Example 1:

Input: coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
# You can make 1, 2, 3 (1+2), 5, 6 (1+5), 7 (2+5), 8 (1+2+5)
# But not 4.

Example 2:

Input: coins = [5, 7, 1, 1, 2, 3, 22]
Output: 20


Constraints:
1 <= len(coins) <= 1e4

1 <= coins[i] <= 1e4
"""


# NAIVE SOLUTION

"""
- sort the array
- have two indexes - from & to
- have a loop counter (change) that starts from 1,
    while True:
        we continue with counter + 1, if we find the counter (change) as a sum of sub-arrays from and to
        whichever number we don't find as change we'll have it when we have had all possible sums in array
